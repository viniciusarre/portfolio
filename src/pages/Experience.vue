            This is a very interesting project I have been working on, since it is helping me shape my interests in working both on an Open Source Project, as well as on an educational system. <br>
            It is a Canadian student-focused electronic health record system, which aims to provide students a simple way to simulate case studies, which is being built using Vue.js, Node.js and MongoDB.

            <p> This was the first project I landed on the platform, I worked on it as a Full-Stack Web developer using React, Redux, Node.js, Express and MongoDB.</p>
            <p>  It was a very interesting project, since it taught me more about the inner workings of a start-up project work and how they're developed in a customer-first approach. </p>
